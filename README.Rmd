**rdynamicscrm** is an R package that creates a client to connect to MS Dynamics CRM. 
Package features include: 

  * An auto-refreshing authentication method (`dyn_auth()`)
  * CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) methods for records, such as: 
    * `dyn_create()`, `dyn_retreive()`, `dyn_update()`, `dyn_delete()`
  * Query records using `dyn_query()`
  * Basic utility calls (`dyn_whoami()`)

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# this package is not yet available on CRAN 
# install the latest version available on GitHub using the devtools package

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StevenMMortimer/rdynamicscrm")
```

If you encounter a clear bug, please file a minimal reproducible example on [GitHub](https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/rdynamicscrm/issues).

## Usage

### Authenticate

First, load the **rdynamicscrm** package and authenticate.

```{r auth, include = FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(purrr)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(here)))
library(rdynamicscrm)
rdynamicscrm_setup <- readRDS(here::here("tests", "testthat", "rdynamicscrm_setup.rds"))
suppressMessages(dyn_auth(url = rdynamicscrm_setup$url, 
                          username = rdynamicscrm_setup$username, 
                          password = rdynamicscrm_setup$password))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(rdynamicscrm)

dyn_auth(url = "https://test.ztcrm.org/",
         username = "test@live.com", 
         password = "{PASSWORD_HERE}")
```

The `dyn_auth()` function will obtain a cipher and secret key that will be embedded 
in the header of each SOAP API call to securely access the CRM instance. After obtaining 
these authentication credentials, you can check your connectivity by looking at 
the information returned about the current user. It should be information about you!

```{r}
# pull down information of person logged in
# it's a simple easy call to get started 
# and confirm a connection to the APIs
me <- dyn_whoami()
my_info <- dyn_retrieve(me$UserId, entity_name="systemuser", 
                        attributes=c("fullname", "isdisabled"))
#sprintf("Name: %s", my_info$fullname)
sprintf("Disabled?: %s", my_info$isdisabled)
```

### Create

MS Dynamics CRM has entities and those entities contain records. One default entity is the 
"contact" entity. This example shows how to create two records in the contact entity.

```{r create-records}
n <- 2
new_contacts <- tibble(firstname = rep("Test", n),
                       lastname = paste0("Contact-Create-", 1:n))
created_records <- dyn_create(new_contacts, entity_name="contact")
created_records
```

### Query

MS Dynamics CRM has proprietary form of SQL called FetchXML. FetchXML is a powerful 
tool that allows you to return the attributes of records on almost any entity in 
MS Dynamics CRM including accounts, contacts, custom entities and more! 

For simple "SELECT" queries you only need to specify the entity and the fields.

```{r query-records-1}
queried_records <- dyn_query(entity_name = "contact",
                             attributes = c("modifiedon", "donotbulkemail"), top=3)
queried_records
```

Below is an example where we grab the two contact records we just created using 
FetchXML to specifically target those records.

```{r query-records-2}
my_fetchxml <- '<fetch version="1.0" output-format="xml-platform" mapping="logical" distinct="false">
                  <entity name="contact" >
                    <attribute name="firstname" />
                    <attribute name="lastname" />
                    <filter type="or">
                      <condition attribute="lastname" operator="eq" value="Contact-Create-1" />
                      <condition attribute="lastname" operator="eq" value="Contact-Create-2" />
                    </filter>
                  </entity>
                </fetch>'  
queried_records <- dyn_query(fetchxml=my_fetchxml)
queried_records
```

### Update

After creating records you can update them using `dyn_update()`. Updating a record 
requires you to pass the MS Dynamics CRM `Id` of the record. MS Dynamics CRM creates 
a GUID (globally unique identifier) on each record and uses that to know which record to 
attach the update information you provide. Simply include a field or column in your 
update dataset called "Id" and the information will be matched. Here is an example 
where we update each of the records we created earlier with a new first name 
called "TestTest".

```{r update-records}
# Update some of those records
queried_records <- queried_records %>%
  mutate(firstname = "TestTest") %>% 
  rename(id=contactid)

updated_records <- dyn_update(queried_records, entity_name="contact")
updated_records
```

### Delete

Records can easily be deleted individually or in bulk by passing a vector of IDs 
to the `dyn_delete()` function. Here we will delete the two records that we created 
in this example.

```{r delete-records}
ids_to_delete <- updated_records$id
deleted_records <- dyn_delete(ids_to_delete, entity_name="contact")
deleted_records
```

## Future

Support for:

 - Online environments (not just On-Premise IFD environments)
 - Upsert 
 - Related Entities

## Credits

This application has derived inspiration from other open source software components. 
The format of the XML in SOAP calls was created by following mimicking implementations 
in [Java](https://github.com/jlattimer/CRMSoapAuthJava) by Jason Lattimer and 
[Python](https://github.com/veeloinc/python-dynamics) by Veelo, Inc. In addition, 
inspiration was drawn from examples created by Jamie Miley that are available on his 
[blog](http://mileyja.blogspot.com/p/microsoft-dynamics-crm-2011-sdk-example.html). 
We acknowledge and are grateful to these developers for their contributions to open source.

## More Information

Microsoft provides support with a C# client library. Unfortunately R is not a supported 
language. However, most all operations supported by Dynamics CRM can be made available 
via this package. This package makes requests best formatted to match what the API 
requires as input. This articulation is not perfect and continued progress will be 
made to add and improve functionality. For details on formatting, attributes, and 
methods please refer to 
[Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/use-microsoft-dynamics-365-organization-service) 
as they are explained better there.
